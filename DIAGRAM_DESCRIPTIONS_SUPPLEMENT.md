# XStateNet Diagram Descriptions Supplement

## State Types Diagram

**State Types Hierarchy Explanation:**

XStateNet implements a rich state type system derived from the XState specification, supporting five distinct state types:

1. **Atomic State** - The simplest state type with no child states. Represents a leaf node in the state hierarchy where actual work is performed. Examples: "idle", "loading", "error".

2. **Compound State** - A state that contains child states with exactly one active child at any time. Implements hierarchical state machines where complex behaviors are decomposed into simpler sub-states. Example: A "processing" state containing "validate", "transform", and "save" sub-states.

3. **Parallel State** - Enables concurrent execution of multiple state regions simultaneously. Each region (shown as Region 1 and Region 2) operates independently with its own set of states. Critical for modeling systems with independent concurrent behaviors like UI state + network state.

4. **Final State** - Indicates completion of a compound or parallel state. When a final state is reached, the parent state is considered complete and may trigger transitions at the parent level. Used for workflow completion signaling.

5. **History State** - Remembers the last active child state of a compound state. Two variants:
   - **Shallow History**: Remembers only the immediate child state
   - **Deep History**: Recursively remembers the entire state configuration including nested states

The diagram shows how these states relate to each other hierarchically. The Parallel state (purple) splits into multiple concurrent regions, while the History state (green) provides memory capabilities for compound states.

## Transition Types Diagram

**Transition Mechanisms Explanation:**

XStateNet supports three fundamental transition types, each with distinct execution semantics:

1. **External Transition** (Red)
   - **Full State Lifecycle**: Exit → Transition Actions → Entry
   - The source state is fully exited (exit actions run)
   - Transition actions execute
   - The target state is fully entered (entry actions run)
   - Used for: Major state changes, state initialization/cleanup
   - Example: Transitioning from "editing" to "saving" requires cleanup and setup

2. **Internal Transition** (Green)
   - **Actions Only**: No state exit or entry
   - The state remains active throughout
   - Only transition actions execute
   - No entry/exit actions are triggered
   - Used for: In-state updates, counter increments, data updates
   - Example: Handling "TYPING" events while in "editing" state

3. **Self Transition** (Blue)
   - **Full Lifecycle on Same State**: Exit → Actions → Entry
   - The state exits itself
   - Transition actions execute
   - The same state is re-entered
   - Both exit and entry actions run
   - Used for: State reset, re-initialization
   - Example: "RESET" button that clears form but stays in "editing" state

**Execution Order:**
- External: `exitSource() → transitionActions() → enterTarget()`
- Internal: `transitionActions()` (no state change)
- Self: `exitSelf() → transitionActions() → enterSelf()`

## EventBusOrchestrator Architecture Diagram

**Orchestration Flow Explanation:**

The EventBusOrchestrator is the beating heart of XStateNet's multi-machine coordination system:

**Event Sources (Top)**:
- **External Events**: From UI, APIs, or external systems
- **Machine-to-Machine Events**: Inter-machine communication
- Individual machines (Machine 1, 2, 3) generate events

**Orchestrator Core (Middle)**:
1. **Event Queue** (Red):
   - Bounded channel with 10,000 capacity
   - FIFO ordering guarantees
   - Thread-safe concurrent writes
   - Single-reader pattern for deterministic processing

2. **Event Router** (Green):
   - Examines target machine ID
   - Validates machine registration
   - Routes to correct machine context
   - Handles routing errors gracefully

3. **Event Processor** (Blue):
   - Dequeues events one at a time
   - Invokes target machine's event handler
   - Manages deferred sends
   - Tracks processing metrics

4. **Machine Contexts**:
   - One context per registered machine
   - Holds deferred send queue
   - Maintains machine-specific state

**Event Targets (Bottom)**:
- Machines receive events through their contexts
- Events are processed asynchronously
- Results flow back through the orchestrator

**Monitoring (Right)**:
- `MachineEventProcessed`: Fired on successful processing
- `MachineEventFailed`: Fired on errors or exceptions

**Key Benefits:**
- **Deterministic**: Events processed in order
- **Isolated**: Machines can't directly interfere with each other
- **Observable**: All events flow through monitoring points
- **Scalable**: Handles 100+ concurrent machines

## Event Flow Sequence Diagram

**Processing Pipeline Explanation:**

This sequence diagram shows the complete lifecycle of an event from submission to completion:

**Phase 1: Event Submission**
1. Application calls `SendEventAsync(toMachineId, event, data)`
2. Orchestrator validates the request
3. Event is enqueued to the channel

**Phase 2: Queue Processing**
4. Background processor dequeues event
5. Target machine ID is validated
6. Machine context is retrieved

**Phase 3: Event Processing**
- **Success Path**:
  7. Machine's `ProcessEvent` is invoked
  8. State transitions occur
  9. Actions execute
  10. Deferred sends are executed
  11. `MachineEventProcessed` event is raised
  12. Result returned to caller

- **Failure Path**:
  7. Exception thrown during processing
  8. Error context is captured
  9. `MachineEventFailed` event is raised
  10. Error propagated to caller

**Key Timing Points:**
- Enqueue: <0.1ms (in-memory operation)
- Dequeue: <0.1ms (channel read)
- Process: 0.3ms average (state machine logic)
- Total latency: ~0.54ms average

## OrchestratedContext Pattern Diagram

**Deferred Send Pattern Explanation:**

The OrchestratedContext implements the deferred send pattern to ensure deterministic behavior:

**Traditional Pattern Problems** (Left Side):
- Action directly calls `SendAsync` during transition
- Can cause race conditions
- State machine modified while transitioning
- Non-deterministic execution order
- Potential deadlocks

**Orchestrated Pattern Solution** (Right Side):

1. **RequestSend (Red)**:
   - Action calls `ctx.RequestSend(targetId, event, data)`
   - Send is NOT executed immediately
   - Request is queued in OrchestratedContext

2. **Deferred Queue (Green)**:
   - Sends accumulated during transition
   - Order preserved (FIFO)
   - No side effects during transition
   - Transition completes atomically

3. **After Transition (Blue)**:
   - Orchestrator invokes `ExecuteDeferredSends()`
   - Queued sends are executed in order
   - Each send goes through orchestrator
   - Target machines process asynchronously

**Benefits:**
- **Deterministic**: Transitions complete before sends
- **Testable**: Can inspect deferred sends before execution
- **Safe**: No concurrent modification
- **Predictable**: Execution order is guaranteed

## Monitoring Architecture Diagram

**Real-Time Monitoring Flow Explanation:**

The monitoring system provides comprehensive observability across both state machine and orchestration layers:

**State Machine Layer Events**:
1. **OnTransition**: Fired when state changes occur
   - Captures: fromState, toState, triggerEvent
   - Timing: After transition completes

2. **OnEventReceived**: Fired when machine receives event
   - Captures: eventName, eventData
   - Timing: Before processing begins

3. **OnActionExecuted**: Fired when actions run
   - Captures: actionName, stateName
   - Timing: After action completes

4. **OnGuardEvaluated**: Fired when guards are checked
   - Captures: guardName, result (true/false)
   - Timing: During transition evaluation

**Orchestrator Layer Events**:
5. **MachineEventProcessed**: Fired after successful event handling
   - Captures: machineId, event, oldState, newState, duration
   - Timing: After complete processing

6. **MachineEventFailed**: Fired when processing fails
   - Captures: machineId, event, exception
   - Timing: On error/exception

**Monitoring Layer**:
- **OrchestratedStateMachineMonitor** (Blue):
  - Subscribes to ALL events from both layers
  - Correlates events by machine ID
  - Aggregates for metrics

- **Event Collector**:
  - Buffers events in memory
  - Applies filters (by machine, event type, etc.)
  - Maintains time-ordered sequence

- **Metrics Calculator**:
  - Computes throughput (events/sec)
  - Tracks latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
  - Counts error rates
  - Identifies bottlenecks

**Application Layer Outputs**:
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Alert triggers on thresholds
- Log aggregation
- Performance reports

## Inter-Machine Communication Diagram

**Message Flow Explanation:**

This diagram illustrates how two machines communicate through the orchestrator:

**Machine A Flow**:
1. Action "OrderProduct" executes in Machine A
2. Calls `ctx.RequestSend("MachineB", "ProcessOrder", orderData)`
3. Request queued in OrchestratedContext (Red)
4. After transition completes, deferred sends execute
5. Event posted to queue (Green)

**Orchestrator Routing**:
6. Event Router (Blue) examines event
7. Determines target is Machine B
8. Routes to Machine B's context

**Machine B Flow**:
9. Machine B in "Idle" state receives "ProcessOrder" event
10. Transition to "Processing" state occurs
11. Processing completes
12. Machine B calls `ctx.RequestSend("MachineA", "OrderCompleted")`
13. Completion event flows back through orchestrator

**Round-Trip Communication**:
- Machine A → Orchestrator → Machine B
- Machine B → Orchestrator → Machine A
- Complete asynchronous request-response pattern

**Key Characteristics:**
- No direct machine-to-machine coupling
- All communication through orchestrator
- Fully asynchronous (no blocking)
- Observable at orchestrator level
- Testable by intercepting messages

## Monitoring Event Sequence

**Event Capture Timeline Explanation:**

This sequence diagram shows the precise timing and order of monitoring events:

**Pre-Processing**:
1. Application sends event to orchestrator
2. Orchestrator forwards to state machine

**Guard Evaluation**:
3. State machine evaluates guard condition
4. `OnGuardEvaluated` event fired → Monitor
5. Monitor captures guard result

**State Exit**:
6. Old state's exit actions execute
7. `OnActionExecuted` events fired for each exit action
8. Monitor captures action execution

**Transition**:
9. Transition actions execute
10. `OnActionExecuted` events fired for transition actions
11. Monitor captures these actions

**State Entry**:
12. New state's entry actions execute
13. `OnActionExecuted` events fired for entry actions
14. Monitor captures entry actions

**Transition Complete**:
15. `OnTransition` event fired
16. Monitor captures state change

**Orchestrator Notification**:
17. `MachineEventProcessed` fired
18. Monitor correlates with machine events

**Result Delivery**:
- Monitor aggregates all events
- Fires consolidated events to application:
  - StateTransitioned
  - ActionExecuted (multiple)
  - GuardEvaluated

**Timing Precision**:
- Events fired synchronously in execution order
- Timestamps accurate to millisecond
- Order guaranteed by sequential processing

## Circuit Breaker State Machine

**Resilience Pattern Explanation:**

The Circuit Breaker pattern protects against cascading failures:

**CLOSED State** (Normal Operation):
- All requests pass through to downstream service
- Success counter increments
- Failure counter tracks errors
- Transition to OPEN when failure threshold exceeded
- Threshold: Typically 50% failure rate over 10 requests

**OPEN State** (Fast-Fail Mode):
- All requests rejected immediately
- Prevents overload of failing service
- Timeout timer starts
- No requests reach downstream
- Allows service time to recover
- Duration: Configurable (default 30 seconds)

**HALF_OPEN State** (Test Mode):
- Limited requests allowed through
- Tests if service recovered
- Single request as probe
- Success → transition to CLOSED (service healthy)
- Failure → transition to OPEN (still failing)
- Success threshold: 1 successful request

**State Transitions:**
- `CLOSED → OPEN`: Failure threshold exceeded
- `OPEN → HALF_OPEN`: Timeout elapsed
- `HALF_OPEN → CLOSED`: Test request succeeded
- `HALF_OPEN → OPEN`: Test request failed

**Implementation in XStateNet:**
```csharp
// Circuit breaker wraps event sends
var result = await circuitBreaker.ExecuteAsync(async () => {
    return await orchestrator.SendEventAsync(machineId, eventName, data);
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents cascade failures
- Fast-fail for better UX
- Automatic recovery
- Configurable thresholds
- Observable state
