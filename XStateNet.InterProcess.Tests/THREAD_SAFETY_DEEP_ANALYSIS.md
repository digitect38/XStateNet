## Timeline of Investigation

### Initial Fix Applied ‚úì
```csharp
private readonly SemaphoreSlim _writeLock = new(1, 1);

private async Task SendMessageAsync(PipeMessage message)
{
    await _writeLock.WaitAsync();
    try
    {
        var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(message);
        await _writer.WriteLineAsync(json);
        await _writer.FlushAsync();
    }
    finally
    {
        _writeLock.Release();
    }
}
```

**Expected**: This should prevent concurrent writes to the same StreamWriter.

**Result**: Still failed! Why?

## Root Cause Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: SemaphoreSlim Not Initialized ‚ùå
**Check**: SemaphoreSlim is initialized in field declaration
```csharp
private readonly SemaphoreSlim _writeLock = new(1, 1); // ‚úì Initialized
```
**Verdict**: NOT the cause

---

### Hypothesis 2: Multiple Instances Problem ‚ùå
**Check**: Each client has its own InterProcessClient instance
```csharp
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
    var client = new InterProcessClient($"concurrent-{i}", _testPipeName);
    clients.Add(client);
}
```
**Each client has**:
- Its own `_writeLock`
- Its own `_writer`
- Its own `StreamWriter`

**Verdict**: NOT the cause - no shared state between clients

---

### Hypothesis 3: Registration Sends During Test ‚ö†Ô∏è LIKELY
**Issue**: When client connects, it sends TWO messages automatically:

```csharp
public async Task ConnectAsync()
{
    // ...
    await RegisterAsync();  // ‚Üê Sends registration message
    _receiveTask = Task.Run(() => ReceiveLoopAsync(_cts.Token));
}

private async Task RegisterAsync()
{
    // Message 1: Register
    await SendMessageAsync(new PipeMessage { Type = MessageType.Register, ... });
    await Task.Delay(100);

    // Message 2: Subscribe
    await SendMessageAsync(new PipeMessage { Type = MessageType.Subscribe, ... });
    await Task.Delay(100);
}
```

**Then test immediately sends**:
```csharp
await client.ConnectAsync();        // Sends 2 messages internally
await Task.Delay(200);              // Wait a bit
// Then test sends 90 more messages (10 clients * 9 targets each)
```

**Problem**:
- ConnectAsync() might still be doing background registration
- Test starts sending immediately after 200ms delay
- Registration and test sends could overlap!

**Verdict**: POSSIBLE but unlikely - we have 200ms delay

---

### Hypothesis 4: Event Handlers Sending Back ‚ö†Ô∏è POSSIBLE
**Code**:
```csharp
client.OnEvent("BROADCAST", evt =>
{
    receivedCounts[machineId]++;  // ‚Üê This is called FROM receive loop
    // What if this triggers another send?
});
```

**Receive Loop**:
```csharp
private async Task ReceiveLoopAsync()
{
    while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested && _reader != null)
    {
        var line = await _reader.ReadLineAsync();
        // ...
        HandleReceivedEvent(evt);  // ‚Üê Calls event handlers synchronously!
    }
}

private void HandleReceivedEvent(MachineEvent evt)
{
    // Invoke handlers
    foreach (var handler in handlers)
    {
        handler(evt);  // ‚Üê SYNCHRONOUS call on receive thread!
    }
}
```

**If handler tries to send**:
```csharp
client.OnEvent("PING", async evt =>
{
    await client.SendEventAsync("other", "PONG", null);  // ‚Üê DEADLOCK RISK!
});
```

**Deadlock scenario**:
1. ReceiveLoop thread calls `HandleReceivedEvent`
2. Handler calls `SendEventAsync`
3. `SendEventAsync` tries to acquire `_writeLock`
4. If main thread is also sending, lock contention occurs

**Verdict**: POSSIBLE but shouldn't cause "stream in use" error

---

### Hypothesis 5: Async/Await State Machine Issue üéØ **ROOT CAUSE**

**The Real Problem**: Look at the error message again:
```
at StreamWriter.WriteLineAsync(String value)
at InterProcessClient.SendMessageAsync(PipeMessage message) Line 233
```

Line 233 is:
```csharp
await _writeLock.WaitAsync();  // ‚Üê Line 233
```

**Wait, that's the LOCK acquisition, not the write!**

Let me re-check the actual line numbers...

Actually, looking at the code:
```csharp
228: private async Task SendMessageAsync(PipeMessage message)
229: {
230:     if (_writer == null)
231:         throw new InvalidOperationException("Writer not initialized");
232:
233:     await _writeLock.WaitAsync();     // ‚Üê Line 233 in error!
234:     try
235:     {
236:         var json = JsonSerializer.Serialize(message);
237:         await _writer.WriteLineAsync(json);
238:         await _writer.FlushAsync();
```

**Error says Line 233 = `StreamWriter.WriteLineAsync`**

This means the **OLD version** of the code was running, NOT the new version with the lock!

---

## The REAL Root Cause: Build Cache Issue

### What Happened:
1. ‚úÖ We added `SemaphoreSlim` to source code
2. ‚úÖ We built the project
3. ‚ùå **Tests were still using OLD compiled DLL from cache!**

### Evidence:
- Error points to Line 233 as `StreamWriter.WriteLineAsync`
- But Line 233 in source is `await _writeLock.WaitAsync()`
- **Line numbers don't match = old binary running**

### Solution Required:

**Clean and rebuild everything**:
```bash
dotnet clean
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test -c Release --no-build
```

**Or force rebuild**:
```bash
rm -rf */bin */obj
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test -c Release
```

---

## Secondary Issue: Test Design Problem

Even after fixing the build cache, there's a test design issue:

### Problem: Broadcast Storm
```csharp
// 10 clients, each sends to 9 others = 90 messages total
// All sent in parallel with Task.WhenAll

var sendTasks = new List<Task>();
foreach (var sender in clients)
{
    foreach (var receiver in clients)
    {
        if (sender.MachineId != receiver.MachineId)
        {
            sendTasks.Add(sender.SendEventAsync(...));  // ‚Üê 90 parallel sends!
        }
    }
}
await Task.WhenAll(sendTasks);  // ‚Üê All at once!
```

**Stress on Named Pipe**:
- 10 clients √ó 9 messages = 90 concurrent writes
- All happening within milliseconds
- Named Pipe server might not handle this well
- Even with locks, this is extremely aggressive

### Better Test Design:
```csharp
// Option 1: Sequential sends per client
foreach (var sender in clients)
{
    var sendTasks = new List<Task>();
    foreach (var receiver in clients)
    {
        if (sender.MachineId != receiver.MachineId)
        {
            sendTasks.Add(sender.SendEventAsync(...));
        }
    }
    await Task.WhenAll(sendTasks);  // Send 9 messages from this client
    await Task.Delay(50);            // Give server time to process
}

// Option 2: Throttle parallelism
var semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(5);  // Max 5 concurrent sends
foreach (var task in allSendTasks)
{
    await semaphore.WaitAsync();
    _ = Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        try { await task; }
        finally { semaphore.Release(); }
    });
}
```

---

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Verify Build
```bash
# Check timestamp of compiled DLL
ls -l XStateNet.InterProcess.TestClient/bin/Release/net9.0/XStateNet.InterProcess.TestClient.dll

# Should be AFTER the time we modified InterProcessClient.cs
```

### Step 2: Verify Source Line Numbers
```bash
# In InterProcessClient.cs, line 233 should be:
grep -n "await _writeLock.WaitAsync()" XStateNet.InterProcess.TestClient/InterProcessClient.cs

# Should output: 233:    await _writeLock.WaitAsync();
```

### Step 3: Clean Rebuild
```bash
dotnet clean
rm -rf XStateNet.InterProcess.TestClient/bin XStateNet.InterProcess.TestClient/obj
rm -rf XStateNet.InterProcess.Tests/bin XStateNet.InterProcess.Tests/obj
dotnet build -c Release
dotnet test XStateNet.InterProcess.Tests -c Release --no-build
```

## Conclusion

### Primary Issue: **Build Cache**
The test was running the OLD version of `InterProcessClient.dll` that didn't have the `SemaphoreSlim` fix.

**Evidence**: Stack trace line 233 points to `StreamWriter.WriteLineAsync` but source code line 233 is `await _writeLock.WaitAsync()`.

### Secondary Issue: **Aggressive Test Design**
90 concurrent sends to Named Pipe server is extremely aggressive and might overwhelm the server even with proper locking.

### Recommended Actions:

1. ‚úÖ **Clean and rebuild** - Force recompilation of all binaries
2. ‚úÖ **Reduce test parallelism** - Don't send 90 messages at once
3. ‚úÖ **Add delays between batches** - Give Named Pipe server time to process
4. ‚úÖ **Reduce client count** - Test with 5 clients instead of 10
5. ‚úÖ **Verify fix** - Ensure SemaphoreSlim is actually being used

### Expected Outcome After Fix:
- All 15 unit tests should PASS ‚úì
- Concurrent client test should work with reduced parallelism
- Performance tests may still be slow but shouldn't crash

## UPDATE: Server-Side Thread-Safety Issue Discovered! üî¥

### New Evidence: JSON Corruption

**Observed at 11:10:43**:
```
[concurrent-6] Failed to parse message: 'I' is an invalid start of a value
[concurrent-0] Failed to parse message: 'Z' is an invalid start of a value
[concurrent-5] ? Received: BROADCAST from concur  ‚Üê Truncated!
```

### Root Cause #2: Server StreamWriter Also Not Thread-Safe!

**Problem**: The message bus server writes to client `StreamWriter`s **without synchronization**:

```csharp
// NamedPipeMessageBus.cs Line 299
await targetWriter.WriteLineAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(eventResponse));
```

**Scenario**:
1. Client A receives event ‚Üí Server Thread 1 writes to Client A's `StreamWriter`
2. Client A receives another event ‚Üí Server Thread 2 writes to SAME `StreamWriter`
3. **JSON messages interleave and corrupt!**

```
Thread 1: {"Success":true,"Data":{"Event":"A"}}
Thread 2:            {"Success":true,"Data":{"Event":"B"}}
Result:   {"Success":true,{"Success":true,"Data":{"Event":"B"}}A"}}
           ‚Üë Corrupted JSON!
```

### Fix Applied to Server:

```csharp
// Added per-client locks
private readonly ConcurrentDictionary<string, SemaphoreSlim> _writerLocks = new();

// Subscribe creates lock for each client
private async Task HandleSubscribeAsync(...)
{
    _clientWriters[machineId] = writer;
    _writerLocks[machineId] = new SemaphoreSlim(1, 1);  // ‚Üê Lock per client
}

// Sending now uses lock
if (_clientWriters.TryGetValue(evt.TargetMachineId, out var targetWriter) &&
    _writerLocks.TryGetValue(evt.TargetMachineId, out var targetLock))
{
    await targetLock.WaitAsync();  // ‚Üê Serialize writes to this client
    try
    {
        await targetWriter.WriteLineAsync(JsonSerializer.Serialize(eventResponse));
        await targetWriter.FlushAsync();
    }
    finally
    {
        targetLock.Release();
    }
}

// Cleanup disposes locks
if (_writerLocks.TryRemove(machineId, out var lockToDispose))
{
    lockToDispose.Dispose();
}
```

### Summary of Complete Fix:

1. **Client-side**: Each `InterProcessClient` has `SemaphoreSlim _writeLock`
   - Prevents concurrent sends from same client

2. **Server-side**: `NamedPipeMessageBus` has per-client locks in `_writerLocks`
   - Prevents server from writing concurrently to same client's `StreamWriter`
