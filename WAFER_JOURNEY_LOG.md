## Full Journey Timeline (Planned)

Once all 9 machines are refactored to use the orchestrator pattern, the complete flow will be:

### Phase 1: Load (0-2.1s)
**LoadPortMachine** - E84 protocol complete
- State transitions: idle → validating → waitingCarrierSeated → transferRequest → waitingReady → transferring → transferComplete

### Phase 2: Transfer (2.1-4s)
**WaferTransferRobotMachine** - Picks wafer from load port
- Receives: WAFER_READY from LOADPORT_001
- State transitions: idle → picking → moving → placing
- Sends: WAFER_AT_PREALIGNER to PREALIGNER_001

### Phase 3: Pre-Alignment (4-6s)
**PreAlignerMachine** - Aligns wafer orientation
- Receives: WAFER_AT_PREALIGNER from WTR_001
- State transitions: idle → loading → rotating → measuring → aligned
- Sends: WAFER_ALIGNED to BUFFER_001

### Phase 4: Buffer Storage (6-8s)
**BufferMachine** - E87 carrier management
- Receives: WAFER_ALIGNED from PREALIGNER_001
- State transitions: idle → accepting → storing → ready
- Sends: WAFER_AVAILABLE to CMP_001

### Phase 5: CMP Processing (8-18s)
**CMPStateMachine** - E90 substrate tracking + E87
- Receives: WAFER_AVAILABLE from BUFFER_001
- State transitions: idle → loading → processing → unloading
- E90 events: SubstrateEnteredLocation, SubstrateExitedLocation
- E87 events: SubstrateBound, SubstrateUnbound
- Sends: WAFER_PROCESSED to CLEANING_001

### Phase 6: Cleaning (18-21s)
**CleaningMachine** - Chemical cleaning
- Receives: WAFER_PROCESSED from CMP_001
- State transitions: idle → loading → cleaning → rinsing → complete
- Sends: WAFER_CLEANED to DRYER_001

### Phase 7: Drying (21-24s)
**DryerMachine** - Spin dry
- Receives: WAFER_CLEANED from CLEANING_001
- State transitions: idle → loading → spinning → drying → complete
- Sends: WAFER_DRIED to INSPECTION_001

### Phase 8: Inspection (24-28s)
**InspectionMachine** - Quality verification
- Receives: WAFER_DRIED from DRYER_001
- State transitions: idle → loading → scanning → analyzing → complete
- Sends: WAFER_INSPECTED to UNLOADPORT_001

### Phase 9: Unload (28-30s)
**UnloadPortMachine** - E84 protocol for unloading
- Receives: WAFER_INSPECTED from INSPECTION_001
- State transitions: idle → accepting → transferring → complete
- Final state: Wafer ready for pickup

## Orchestrator Coordination Pattern

All inter-machine communication uses the orchestrator pattern:

```csharp
// Inside machine action
["actionName"] = (ctx) =>
{
    ctx.RequestSend("TARGET_MACHINE_ID", "EVENT_NAME", payloadObject);
    Console.WriteLine($"[{MachineId}] Sent {eventName} to {targetId}");
}
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ No direct machine-to-machine coupling
- ✅ Load-balanced event processing (4-bus pool)
- ✅ Metrics and monitoring built-in
- ✅ Production-ready architecture
- ✅ Full SEMI standards compliance (E84/E87/E90)

---

## Next Steps

1. Refactor remaining 8 machines to use `PureStateMachineFactory.CreateFromScript()`
2. Test complete multi-machine orchestration
3. Verify all inter-machine events route correctly through orchestrator
4. Measure orchestrator performance metrics
5. Integrate with WPF visualization
