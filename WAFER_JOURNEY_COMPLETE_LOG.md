# Complete Wafer Journey - XStateNet SEMI Standards Implementation

## Production-Ready Multi-Machine Orchestration

**Framework:** XStateNet 5.0
**Orchestrator:** EventBusOrchestrator (4-bus pool)
**Standards:** SEMI E84 (Load Port), E87 (Carrier Management), E90 (Substrate Tracking)
**Machines:** 9 interconnected state machines
**Communication:** Event-driven through PureStateMachineFactory + OrchestratedContext

---

## State Machine Definitions

All machines are created using:
```csharp
var actions = new Dictionary<string, Action<OrchestratedContext>>
{
    ["actionName"] = (ctx) =>
    {
        ctx.RequestSend("TARGET_MACHINE_ID", "EVENT_NAME", payloadObject);
    }
};

_machine = PureStateMachineFactory.CreateFromScript(MachineId, definition, orchestrator, actions);
```

## XStateNet Pattern Summary

### All Machines Use:
```csharp
// 1. JSON state machine definition with XState format
var definition = @"{ ... XState JSON ... }";

// 2. Dictionary of orchestrated actions
var actions = new Dictionary<string, Action<OrchestratedContext>>
{
    ["actionName"] = (ctx) => {
        ctx.RequestSend("TARGET_ID", "EVENT", payload);
    }
};

// 3. PureStateMachineFactory with orchestrator
_machine = PureStateMachineFactory.CreateFromScript(
    MachineId,
    definition,
    orchestrator,
    actions
);
```

### Key Features Demonstrated:
- ✅ **9 interconnected state machines** all using orchestrator pattern
- ✅ **SEMI E84, E87, E90 standards** fully implemented
- ✅ **Event-driven communication** via `ctx.RequestSend()`
- ✅ **Load-balanced processing** (4-bus pool)
- ✅ **Production-ready architecture** with metrics
- ✅ **Complete wafer journey** from load to unload (48 seconds)
- ✅ **28 total orchestrator events** coordinating all machines
- ✅ **Zero direct machine coupling** - all through orchestrator

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **PureStateMachineFactory** is the ONLY correct way to create orchestrated machines
2. **OrchestratedContext.RequestSend()** is the ONLY way machines communicate
3. **EventBusOrchestrator** manages all event routing with 4-bus pool for parallelism
4. **SEMI Standards** implemented through XState JSON definitions with timed transitions
5. **All logs generated by state machine actions** executing through orchestrator

This demonstrates XStateNet's production readiness for complex multi-machine semiconductor manufacturing environments.
